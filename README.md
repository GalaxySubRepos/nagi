so I stole part of [pyroscope] and hacked up a simple script.

I have not tested this on any .torrent/directory combinations it should do any
renaming on, so I'm just assuming it works! No testing on different OSs or
versions of Python, either, so don't expect much.

I think it likely I'll make a super-simple gui for it, but the cli will remain.

Name unrelated: [Nagi] is a character from Hayate no Gotoku.
